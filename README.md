# FifaOptimalPosition
Place 10 players in players.csv along with their ratings and card type and this will return the most optimal formation to play (according to FUTbins Rating per Position (RPP) system) as well as where to place your players. This is mostly a hobby project and not really intended to ever be used, but here it is anyway!

# Future Development
* Although this is set up to work with FIFA 24, EA has changed the way positions work. So this includes the newest players but still works on the old position system where you had snipe position change cards for 10 mins to change your ST to CAM. I am looking to update this to the new position system!
* Currently, this does not update live cards like the UCL RTTF cards. I am working on it and this is like 90% done.
* I will be working towards making this a Chrome Extension! I would try Firefox too but FUTbin runs incredibly badly on Firefox.
